## üìà How DASHH Works

### 1. **Campaign Creation**  
Brands set up campaigns, allocate a budget, and share them through the Okto Wallet SDK, using Reclaim Protocol for Instagram verification and zkTLS proofs to ensure privacy and security.

### 2. **User Participation**  
Influencers connect their wallets through the Okto Wallet SDK, verify their Instagram account via Reclaim, and participate by posting stories that will generate real engagement.

### 3. **Engagement Proof**  
Reclaim Protocol collects engagement data (e.g., Instagram views) and generates zkTLS proofs, ensuring that the engagement is real and verified.

### 4. **Payment Distribution**  
Once engagement is verified, payments are processed securely through Okto Wallet SDK's escrow functionality, ensuring influencers are rewarded fairly and without delay.
